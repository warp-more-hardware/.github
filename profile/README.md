This project is to port the awsome software of the [TinkerForge](https://www.tinkerforge.com/) [WARP Charger](https://www.warp-charger.com/) to other hardware.

For now all [development](https://github.com/warp-more-hardware/esp32-firmware/commits/master) as well as [documentation](https://github.com/warp-more-hardware/esp32-firmware/wiki) and [releases](https://github.com/warp-more-hardware/esp32-firmware/releases) are in the [esp32-firmware](https://github.com/warp-more-hardware/esp32-firmware) repository.

The main focus for now is the AC011K hardware.
